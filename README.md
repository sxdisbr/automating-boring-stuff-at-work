# automating-boring-stuff-at-work
This repository compiles all the boring stuff I had to do manually and painfully at work.
I am working in an international news agency as a correspondent, but my tasks also implies several boring and manually boring stuff like: how many quotes in mass media all over the world we had the last week? how many news we had published in the last month? and so on.. when I knew about python was like a divine revelation, all these tasks were resolved with a few simple programs that made my life so much easier. Now I am a true beliver. Long life the language of the gods!
